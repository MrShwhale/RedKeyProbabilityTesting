# RedKeyProbabilityTesting
A simple script to get the chances of the Red Key from Binding of Isaac of generating a specific room type

This was my first Lua script, and it was built to open a lot of rooms, keep track of what type they are, reset the run, and repeat. 

This makes it easy to get thousands of rooms generated, which is helpful for determining rough probability of the key without looking into the code. 

To use it, just run the script in the debug console. Then, call the StartRepeatedMapping() function, with an optional parameter for how many times to run. 

To see your stats, use the DisplayStats() function in the console.

Have fun! Remember to share any testing done with the community, so we can all benefit.
